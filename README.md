# 🎥 Sigma Cloud D-Guard Integration

## 📋 Overview

This service provides comprehensive management and integration for the Sigma Cloud D-Guard ecosystem, focusing on synchronizing and maintaining up-to-date information about clients, mosaics (virtual matrix layouts), and users (workstations). It acts as a middleware layer connecting local data storage with multiple active D-Guard servers, ensuring consistent, real-time reflection of system configurations.

A key feature is the ability to dynamically change virtual matrix layouts on user workstations in response to events triggered within the Sigma Cloud platform. When a relevant event occurs, the service assigns the appropriate layout to the user’s workstation, enabling seamless, event-driven display updates.

### 🎯 Objectives

- Synchronize and maintain up-to-date information for clients, mosaics (layouts), and users (workstations) across multiple active Sigma Cloud D-Guard servers
- Enable dynamic assignment and switching of virtual matrix layouts on user workstations triggered by Sigma Cloud events
- Securely communicate with D-Guard servers using encrypted credentials and token-based authentication
- Manage lifecycle operations for mosaics and users, including addition, update, and removal to ensure data consistency
- Provide robust error handling and detailed logging for reliable operational monitoring
- Support scalable, event-driven integration to enhance situational awareness and display management
- Deliver structured, real-time data outputs to facilitate actionable workflows and seamless Sigma Cloud platform integration
